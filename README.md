# Movies-ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Practice

The Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process is used to create data pipelines in this module. The ETL process creates data pipelines that transform data as it travels from one location to another. In order to perform analysis, one must first set up a pipeline of data that can be used for analysis. As a result, the ability to perform data analysis without the use of ETL is extremely limited.

## Project Overview
To find out which low-budget films will go viral, Amazing Prime, a streaming service, is hosting a hackathon in which participants must guess which ones will be the most successful. Predictive models can only be built with an ETL pipeline. The goal of this project is to create an ETL pipeline that can be refactored to process large datasets into a SQL database.

## Project Deliverables
- Deliverable 1: Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files
- Deliverable 2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data
- Deliverable 3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle Data
- Deliverable 4: Create the Movie Database
